# mediaLibraryPlacer
This is purely a project for myself and the way I manage my media files.   
I have intentions to add options/settings to allow changing of folders/structure and make it more open to more people in the future

# TODO: Before others can use
1. Implement settings and save/load so people can use own folders

# TODO:
1. Episodes, Add to Queue and move
2. Queue - More options around move/copy

Way it works currently.
1. If a file is on the same drive/share, it will MOVE to the new location
2. if on a a different drive/share, it will remux into MKV using MKVMerge
3. Supports subtitles files in the same folder as the movie/episodes
